# Flower Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

ResNet18_TensorBoard_DataAugmented_HyperparamsTuned.ipynb implements hyperparameter tuning with data augmentation.

Baseline_ResNet18_TensorBoard.ipynb is our baseline model.

Baseline_ResNet18_TensorBoard_DataAugmented.ipynb is our baseline model with data augmentation.

Evaluation_Metrics.ipynb visualizes evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.

Visualize_Data.ipynb visualizes the distributions of the training set and the validation set.

The flower images we are classifying are accessible from here: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/
