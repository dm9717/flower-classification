# flower-classification

Baseline_ResNet18_TensorBoard.ipynb implements the up-to-date version of our baseline model.

Baseline_ResNet18_Extended.ipynb visualizes prediction results in the form of a matrix.

Visualize_Data.ipynb visualizes the distributions of the training set and the validation set.

The flower images we are classifying are accessible from here: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/
